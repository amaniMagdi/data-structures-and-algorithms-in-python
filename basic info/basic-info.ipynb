Unless otherwise stated, the term _complexity_ always refers to the worst-case complexity (i.e. the highest possible time/space taken by the program/algorithm to process an input).\n",

In the Big O, we drop fixed constants and lower powers of variables to capture the trend of relationship between the size of the input and the complexity of the algorithm i.e. if the complexity of the algorithm is `cN^3 + dN^2 + eN + f`, in the Big O notation it is expressed as **O(N^3)**"
