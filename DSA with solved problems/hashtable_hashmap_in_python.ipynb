However, there are some subtle differences between the two terms.\n\nTechnically speaking, a hashtable is a more general term that refers to any data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to indices in an array. A hashmap is a specific type of hashtable that uses chaining to handle collisions (i.e., when two or more keys hash to the same index).\n\nIn Python, the built-in dictionary data type is implemented as a hashmap. When you add a key-value pair to a dictionary, Python hashes the key to determine the index in the underlying array where the value should be stored. If there is already a value stored at that index (i.e., a collision has occurred), Python uses linked lists to chain together all the key-value pairs that have hashed to that index.\n\nSo, in practice, the difference between a hashtable and a hashmap in Python is largely semantic. Both terms refer to the same underlying data structure, with the same performance characteristics and features. ***The built-in dictionary type in Python is a highly optimized and efficient implementation of a hashmap, and it is the recommended way to store and retrieve key-value pairs in most Python applications.***\n\n",
